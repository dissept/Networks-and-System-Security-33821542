        "\n",
        "## 1. Introduction\n",
        "The purpose of this assessment was to evaluate the security posture of a deliberately vulnerable web application using the Wapiti web vulnerability scanner. Google Gruyere was chosen as the target due to its safe and controlled testing environment for learning offensive security concepts. The goal of this lab was to identify potential vulnerabilities, understand their implications, and provide mitigation strategies aligned with industry best practices and OWASP standards.\n",

        "- **Scanner:** Wapiti 3.2.3\n",
        "- **Scan Type:** Black-box\n",
        "- **Target:** https://google-gruyere.appspot.com/<instance>/\n",
        "- **Output Format:** HTML and console report\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.2 Procedure\n",
        "1. A unique Gruyere training instance was deployed.\n",
        "2. The scanner was executed with:\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   wapiti -u <target> -o wapiti_report -f html\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "3. Wapiti crawled 10 pages and injected payloads for multiple vulnerability classes.\n",
        "4. Results were analysed and interpreted against OWASP testing guidelines.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.3 Exclusions\n",
        "- No authentication brute force\n",
        "- No destructive payloads\n",

        "3. Local Port Scan Results\n",
        "\n",
        "The port scanner identified which common ports were open on my localhost. Depending on the machine, this usually includes ports like 22 (SSH), 80/443 (web services), or 8080 (development servers). The simple scanner can’t confirm what is running, but the ports give a good indication of likely services.\n",

        "python-nmap produced far more detailed results than the basic scanner. It showed service names, version information, and protocol details, while the simple Python scanner only reported whether a port was open. Nmap essentially performs real enumeration, whereas the basic script is just a connectivity test.\n",
